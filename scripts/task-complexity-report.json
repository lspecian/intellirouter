      "taskTitle": "Project Setup and Core Architecture",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into subtasks for initializing the repository, configuring the Rust project, establishing directory structure, setting up configuration management, implementing CLI parsing, Dockerization, CI/CD, and scaffolding each core module directory.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves foundational work across multiple domains: Rust project setup, architecture design, configuration management, Docker/CI integration, and scaffolding for all core modules. Each area requires careful planning and implementation, making the overall complexity high and justifying a detailed subtask breakdown."
