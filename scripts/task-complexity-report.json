      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of the intellirouter-test-utils crate into detailed steps including: 1) Setting up the crate structure, 2) Implementing the basic modules (fixtures, mocks, helpers), and 3) Configuring workspace integration.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward task with clear steps for creating a new crate. The complexity is low as it involves standard Rust project setup procedures that are well-documented. The task is self-contained with no dependencies."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Create Organized Test Directory Structure",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of the test directory structure into: 1) Creating the main test directories (unit, integration, e2e, bin), 2) Setting up mod.rs files with proper module declarations, and 3) Creating the README.md with comprehensive testing documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This is a simple task involving directory creation and basic file setup. The structure is clearly defined in the task description, and there are no technical challenges beyond standard file system operations."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Cargo configuration update into: 1) Adding dev-dependencies including the test-utils crate, 2) Configuring feature flags for test utilities, 3) Setting up test-only binaries and test configurations, and 4) Verifying the configuration works correctly.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires understanding of Cargo's configuration system and how to properly separate test code from production code. It has a dependency on task #1 and requires careful configuration to ensure tests run correctly while keeping the production binary clean."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Identify and Extract Common Test Utilities",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the extraction of test utilities into: 1) Scanning the codebase for test utility code, 2) Categorizing utilities by type (fixtures, mocks, helpers), 3) Moving code to the test-utils crate with proper module organization, 4) Updating imports in existing test files, and 5) Implementing feature flags for utilities that must remain in the main codebase.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires thorough code analysis and refactoring across the codebase. It has higher complexity because it involves identifying code patterns, making decisions about what to extract, and ensuring all references are updated correctly. It depends on both the test-utils crate and directory structure being in place."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Move Module-Specific Test Files",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of moving module-specific test files into: 1) Identifying all test files in the src directory, 2) Creating corresponding directory structures in tests/unit/, 3) Moving each test file with appropriate import updates, and 4) Verifying all moved tests still pass.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves significant refactoring of test files across the codebase. The complexity comes from ensuring all imports are correctly updated and that test functionality is preserved. It depends on the test directory structure and Cargo configuration being set up correctly."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Move Custom Test Runner",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down moving the custom test runner into: 1) Creating the tests/bin directory and moving the runner file, 2) Updating imports and configurations in the test runner to work with the new structure, and 3) Testing the runner to ensure it works correctly with the new test organization.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex as it involves moving a specific component and ensuring it continues to function correctly. The test runner likely has dependencies on other parts of the codebase that need to be updated, but the scope is limited to a single file."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Remove Test Code from Production Modules",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the removal of test code from production modules into: 1) Scanning the codebase for test code in production modules, 2) Categorizing test code for appropriate relocation, 3) Moving test modules to the unit test directory, 4) Implementing feature flags for necessary test helpers, and 5) Verifying production code still compiles and functions correctly.",
      "reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task requiring careful code analysis and refactoring. There's risk of breaking production functionality if test code is incorrectly removed. It requires understanding of how test code might be intertwined with production code and depends on multiple previous tasks being completed."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Update CI/CD Pipeline Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the CI/CD pipeline update into: 1) Identifying all CI/CD configuration files that need updates, 2) Modifying test commands to work with the new structure, 3) Adding separate steps for different test categories, and 4) Adding verification steps to ensure test code is not included in production builds.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires understanding of CI/CD systems and how they interact with the test structure. It has moderate complexity because it involves updating configuration files that affect the build and test process, with potential for breaking the CI pipeline if done incorrectly."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Create Integration Tests Structure",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration tests structure creation into: 1) Identifying existing integration tests in the codebase, 2) Creating appropriate subdirectories in tests/integration/, 3) Moving integration tests to the new structure with updated imports, and 4) Creating a comprehensive mod.rs file that includes all integration test modules.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves organizing integration tests which may have complex dependencies and requirements. It requires understanding how integration tests interact with the system and ensuring they continue to function correctly after being moved."
