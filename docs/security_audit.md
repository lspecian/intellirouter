# IntelliRouter Security Audit System

This document provides an overview of the IntelliRouter Security Audit System, which is designed to identify security vulnerabilities, track security metrics over time, and provide guidance on fixing security issues.

## Overview

The Security Audit System is a comprehensive framework for monitoring and improving the security posture of the IntelliRouter project. It consists of several components:

1. **Security Audit Framework**: A collection of scripts that run various security checks and collect metrics.
2. **Security Checks**: Individual checks for different types of security vulnerabilities.
3. **Security Metrics Tracking**: A system for tracking security metrics over time and visualizing trends.
4. **CI Integration**: Integration with continuous integration systems to run security checks automatically.
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation on how to use the security audit system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The security audit system requires the following tools:

- Bash (version 4.0 or later)
- Cargo and Rust toolchain
- cargo-audit (install with `cargo install cargo-audit`)
- jq (for JSON processing)
- gnuplot (for generating charts)

### Running a Security Audit

To run a complete security audit, use the `run_security_audit.sh` script:

```bash
scripts/security/run_security_audit.sh
```

This will run all security checks and generate a report in the default location (`metrics/security/`).

### Options

The security audit script supports several options:

- `--checks`: Specify which security checks to run (e.g., `dependencies,code,config`)
- `--severity`: Set the minimum severity level to report (low, medium, high, critical)
- `--format`: Choose the report format (json, markdown, html)
- `--output`: Specify the output directory for reports
- `--fix`: Attempt to automatically fix issues where possible
- `--ci`: Run in CI mode (non-interactive, exit code reflects security status)

For a complete list of options, run:

```bash
scripts/security/run_security_audit.sh --help
```

## Security Checks

The security audit system includes the following checks:

### Dependency Vulnerabilities (`check_dependencies.sh`)

This check uses `cargo-audit` to scan Rust dependencies for known vulnerabilities. It checks the `Cargo.lock` file against the RustSec Advisory Database.

```bash
scripts/security/check_dependencies.sh
```

### Code Vulnerabilities (`check_code.sh`)

This check performs static code analysis to identify potential security issues in the codebase. It uses Clippy with security-focused lints to identify issues like:

- Unwrap/expect usage that could lead to panics
- Unchecked arithmetic that could lead to overflows
- Unsafe code without proper documentation
- Memory safety issues

```bash
scripts/security/check_code.sh
```

### Configuration Issues (`check_config.sh`)

This check examines configuration files for security issues like:

- Hardcoded secrets
- Insecure defaults
- Missing security-critical settings
- Overly permissive settings

```bash
scripts/security/check_config.sh
```

### Authentication and Authorization (`check_auth.sh`)

This check examines authentication and authorization mechanisms for security issues like:

- Weak authentication methods
- Missing authorization checks
- Insecure session management
- Insufficient access controls

```bash
scripts/security/check_auth.sh
```

### Data Validation (`check_data.sh`)

This check examines data validation and sanitization for security issues like:

- Missing input validation
- Insufficient output encoding
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

```bash
scripts/security/check_data.sh
```

### Network Security (`check_network.sh`)

This check examines network security for issues like:

- Insecure communication protocols
- Missing TLS/SSL
- Weak cipher suites
- Insecure API endpoints

```bash
scripts/security/check_network.sh
```

## Security Metrics Tracking

The security audit system tracks security metrics over time to help identify trends and measure progress. Metrics are stored in CSV format in the `metrics/security/` directory.

### Generating Charts

To generate charts from security metrics, use the `generate_security_charts.sh` script:

```bash
scripts/security/generate_security_charts.sh
```

This will generate charts showing trends in security issues over time.

### Metrics Dashboard

The security metrics tracking system includes a dashboard that provides a visual overview of security metrics. The dashboard is generated as an HTML file and can be viewed in a web browser.

## CI Integration

The security audit system can be integrated with continuous integration systems to run security checks automatically. The `ci_security_audit.sh` script is designed for this purpose:

```bash
scripts/security/ci_security_audit.sh
```

This script runs security checks in CI mode and can be configured to fail the build if security issues are found.

### GitHub Actions Integration

To integrate with GitHub Actions, add the following to your workflow file:

```yaml
name: Security Audit

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Run weekly

jobs:
  security-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        cargo install cargo-audit
        sudo apt-get install -y jq gnuplot
    - name: Run security audit
      run: scripts/security/ci_security_audit.sh
    - name: Upload security reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: security-reports
        path: metrics/security/
```

## Best Practices

### Regular Audits

Run security audits regularly to identify and address security issues early. Consider:

- Running audits before major releases
- Scheduling weekly or monthly audits
- Running audits after significant code changes

### Severity Levels

The security audit system uses the following severity levels:

- **Critical**: Issues that could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or other severe security incidents. These should be fixed immediately.
- **High**: Issues that could lead to significant security problems but may require specific conditions to exploit. These should be fixed as soon as possible.
- **Medium**: Issues that could lead to security problems in certain scenarios. These should be fixed in the next release.
- **Low**: Issues that represent minor security concerns or best practice violations. These should be fixed when convenient.

### Fixing Issues

When fixing security issues, consider the following:

1. **Understand the issue**: Make sure you understand the root cause of the issue before attempting to fix it.
2. **Follow best practices**: Use established security best practices when implementing fixes.
3. **Test thoroughly**: Test your fixes to ensure they address the issue without introducing new problems.
4. **Document changes**: Document the changes you make to fix security issues, including the rationale for the changes.

## Extending the Security Audit System

The security audit system is designed to be extensible. To add a new security check:

1. Create a new script in the `scripts/security/` directory
2. Follow the pattern of existing check scripts
3. Update the `run_security_audit.sh` script to include your new check

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all required tools are installed.
- **Permission issues**: Make sure the scripts are executable (`chmod +x scripts/security/*.sh`).
- **Report generation failures**: Check that the output directory exists and is writable.

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with the security audit system, please:

1. Check this documentation for guidance
2. Look for error messages in the script output
3. File an issue in the project repository
